# Introduction
By observing, I find it's a case to case fuzzing for a specific service.
(e.g., the crash of the app by blind fuzzing will hinder the further test.)

1. `huaweiAI` is used to fuzz [huawei ai service](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/overview/HUAWEI_HiAI).
2. `huaweiSurity` is used to fuzz [huawei security service](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/Security-Guides/introduction-0000001051069988).
