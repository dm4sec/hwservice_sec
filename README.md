## About
1. `service_fuzzer` is used to perform a context-aware fuzzing of (hw)service.
2. `idc_script` is used to distill interfaces and arguments of a given server.
3. `case_study` is a collection of examples of target specific fuzzing.

*I have handed on this project to my colleague and move on to the other project.*
